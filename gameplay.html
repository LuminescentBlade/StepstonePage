			<h2> Gameplay</h2>
			<blockquote>
			<p>The player will select to play as either Alex, the male protagonist, or Angela, the female protagonist, before they start the actual gameplay.</p>
			<p>The game works like a platformer, with the player being able to run left. The player must dodge the objects thrown at them while using the objects as their platform to jump on in order to reach the wizard in the tower. Once they reach the wizard, they will be able to slay the wizard and win the level.</p>
			<p>Certain objects, however, instead of damaging the player, will act as a power up or a power down. For example, the bunny cape will give the player a higher jump.</p>
			
			<p>There will be three levels in the game, one desert level, one city level, and one forest level. The objects and power ups the wizard throws may sometimes differ by the level.</p>
